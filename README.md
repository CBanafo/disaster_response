# Victim Message Classification

<p style=text-align:"justify">During occassions of emergencies, information received could be a bit bulky as situations come in different forms. As a result, we target these messages to more precise groups to be dealt with quickly and much effectively.</p>
<p style=text-align:"justify">We create a front end application using flask where messages from victims are sorted according to the right categories most suited for it using effective machine learning modules.</p>
